# NoSQL Challenge

This assignment analyzes UK food establishments' hygiene ratings. It includes Jupyter notebooks for database setup, updates, and exploratory analysis, addressing tasks from data import to querying for insights. The project highlights key findings for the food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, focusing on hygiene scores and ratings, including new additions like "Penang Flavours".

I had to compress the resources folder with the json because github would not allow me to upload the large json file.
